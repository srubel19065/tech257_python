# Guess the word with 4 hints to help
# Rationale: Practice word slicing
# Type of exercise: Finish the code
original_word = "recommendation"
scrambled_word = "eoommandretnic"
# Create the hint slices...
hint1_slice = original_word[4:6] # TO DO Create the word slice according to the clue below, use the format "original_word[x:y]"
hint2_slice = original_word[-3:] # TO DO Create the word slice according to the clue below, use the format "original_word[x:y]"
hint3_slice = original_word[7:9] # TO DO Create the word slice according to the clue below, use the format "original_word[x:y]"
hint4_slice = original_word[:2] # TO DO Create the word slice according to the clue below, use the format "original_word[x:y]"
