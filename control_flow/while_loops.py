#Create a new file named 'while_loops.py' or similar.

#Initialise x with the value of 0

#Create a while statement so that it loops while x is less than 10. Everytime it loops it should:

#Print the value of x to the screen in an f-string

#Increment (add 1 to x)


x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(f"print x -> {x}")
    x += 1

print("---------------------------------")

#Once your code works, find out what happens when you run the code if you comment out the first line which initialises 'x'.

#Write a brief comment on the line before the code which increments x to explain what would happen if you don't increment x.

#Copy and paste your working 'while loop' underneath the 'while loop'. Modify the second copy of the 'while loop' so that it breaks out of the loop when x equals 4.#

x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(f"print x -> {x}")
    if x == 4:
        break
    x += 1
